# Rotten Tomatoes App using React Canvas

I built this app to try React Canvas and test scroll performance.
It's heavily based on the css-layout and ListView examples in React Canvas.
Please note that I didn't spend a ton of time on this so it may have some issues. I welcome pull requests!

It works best on mobile. Try adding it to your homescreen to remove the browser's UI chrome.

The app looks like this (it displays the top 50 rentals on Rotten Tomatoes):
